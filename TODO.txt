TODO:
	Investigate ranges of 1,2,3,4. (Valid or not?)

	parsing is now 20.8% of runtime. (57% of which is in a custom strtol).
	fwrite() Now takes approximately 60% of execution time, while reading
	takes 11.5%. I'm not sure how to further reduce the parsing percentage,
	so I'll have to investiagte decreasing the contribution of fwrite().

	This will necessitate changing the output format to be better. (Which
	we need to do anyway).
