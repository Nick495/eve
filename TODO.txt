TODO:
	Investigate streaming compression options for the file writeout.
	(lz4 seemed promising, but it seems to require an integer for each
	compressed block, which isn't really a savings for most of my data.)

	Investigate ranges of 1,2,3,4. (Valid or not?)

	Test the new parser functions in eve_parser (should be _much_ faster
	than scanf, and internally they're less code which is cleaner too).
