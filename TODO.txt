TODO:
	Bit arrays are a major pain in the ass to persist, so we'll just use byte
	arrays and take the hit of an (at most 27 byte) header (for lz4) per 4K
	block (.659% overhead) for ease of use.

	lz4 provides a nice LZ4_compress_destSize, which compresses as much data as
	will fit in the dst buffer. Unfortunately, Our data is often larger than a
	single char, so we'll have to do some magic to make sure that we don't have
	half an integer in one block and half an integer in another.

	In terms of the blocks themselves, I've decided upon a simple header scheme
	of only having the number of elements in the block. Since our blocks are 4k
	big, and the smallest possible element can take 1 bit, we need 15 bits per
	block for a count. (Assuming each element reduces to 1 bit of output size).
	Therefore, we'll reserve 2 bytes per block for a 16 bit count. That leaves
	us 4094 bytes for payload.
