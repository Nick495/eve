TODO: In order of precedence.
	Create a function that sets the datum dptr and dsize at the same time.
		(Usability plus)

	Refactor functions to include error codes (store(), add a close(), etc)
	Refactor to use an mmap() backend versus the current write()

	Refactor to make it a dynamic array versus the current hash table
	Refactor global numbers to be context dependent (e.g. make a DB object)
